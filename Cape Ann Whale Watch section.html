<h2> Cape Ann Whale Watch </h2>
<h3> My job </h3>
<p> At CAWW, I am called an Educator. Educators use "teaching tools" to help passengers understand more about the wildlife they may be seeing, and about the Stellwagen bank area. The duties of an Educator are as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li> Arrive at the boat, prepare the cabin for passengers </li>  <br>
<li> Greet passengers as they get on the boat, tell the taller ones to watch their heads so they don't hit it on the upper deck </li>  <br>
<li> As soon as everyone is on board, listen to the "dock talk," then go to the crew's cabin </li>  <br>
<li> As the boat is leaving Gloucester harbor, someone will give a tour of the harbor, and it might be me. </li>  <br>
<li> A short ways out, Educators emerge with "teaching tools" such as baleen, model whale teeth, recordings of whale songs, a 3d model of Stellwagen bank, rubber sand eels that represent the whales' food, and pictures. Not only do these tools provide some entertainment during the long trip out, they are educational, and our presence is a good opportunity for curious minds. </li>  <br>
<li> As soon as we get to where the whales are, it's time to spot them! If we see one, we use a clock system to call out its location to the naturalist, and she will announce it over the PA. </li>  <br>
<li> There will always be one qualitative data taker, one quantitative data taker, and one photographer. Anyone who does mot have one of these duties continues spotting whales. </li> <br>
<li> When it's time to head back, Educators will come around with different "teaching tools" to follow up. One of the Educators will play with the little kids with sea animal toys. </li> <br>
<li> As soon as we get back to the dock, Educators make sure passengers stay on the starboard side of the boat so the crew can dock. </li> <br>
<li> As the passengers leave, Educators thank them for coming and hand out brochures. </li> <br>
<li> We clean up and go home. I'm the only one under 21, so sometimes everyone else goes out to the bar and I just go home. </li>
</ol>
<h3> What I learned </h3>
<p> At Cape Ann Whale Watch, I learned how to advocate for something I'm passionate about, I learned public speaking skills and responsibility as a member of a team, and I learned what I want to do with my life career-wise. </p>
<h3> Photos </h3>
<p> Enjoy some photos I took while aboard the Hurricane II. </p> <br>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/9x/vy/fbxv5.jpg" alt="Whale fluking">
<p> This Humpback whale is diving so that the tail, or fluke, is visible. This behavior is called fluking, and typically happens before a longer and deeper dive. The multiple whale watching boats in the background show the popularity of Stellwagen bank as a whale watch spot. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/mb/d3/rgjkt.jpg" alt="Whale spouting">
<p> The plume you see coming off of this Humpback whale is not water, it's the whale's breath. These are called spouts, and can be used to identify the species of whale. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/q8/cj/j453m.jpg" alt="Whale sounding">
<p> This is a Humpback whale performing a sounding dive. During a sounding dive, the whale's back arches but the tail does not come out of the water. These are typically shorter, shallower dives. The hump that is formed as this whale sounds is how the humpback whale got its common name. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/wi/bw/s9ik4.jpg" alt="Whale with seagulls">
<p> Feeding whales are often surrounded by seabirds, hoping to catch some leftovers </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/zk/wf/sbrs3.jpg" alt="Bright sun">
<p> Passengers on the deck enjoy fresh air and the setting sun. We are approaching the coast of Gloucester. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/ma/zm/bmj7g.jpg" alt="Boat wake">
<p> The Hurricane II can get up to 30 knots. This creates substantial wake. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/k9/fz/c73gy.jpg" alt="Humpback whale fins">
<p> From the surface, a Humpback Whale's fins look greenish. This is due to algae and plankton in the water that shows above their white fins. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/zj/fr/mv9ed.jpg" alt="Oil slick">
<p> Humpback whales are identified by their unique tail, or fluke markings. They are photographed whenever possible. Whales are named after such markings. The names must be gender-neutral, because you cannot tell a whale's gender by observation unless you see her with a calf. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/gw/cs/kab2w.jpg" alt="Photo">
<p> This patch of smooth water looks like an oil slick, but it's really a whale's "footprint." This phenomenon occurs when a whale's caudal fin pushes water to the surface. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/u4/4i/r8t7p.jpg" alt="Photo">
<p> These whales are going under for a group fishing effort. They can either blow bubble nets, or make a lot of noise to scare the fish into a smaller and easily edible ball. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/qb/8d/6dfa3.jpg" alt="People on deck">
<p> At sea, it is colder and windier than on land. The more prepared guests have windbreakers, but we can see one intrepid soul in a tank top. This picture was taken from the upper deck, in a spot where only crew are allowed. </p>
<img style="border-radius:1em" src="http://img.ourdoings.com/gx/mx/frzdk.jpg" alt="Gloucester harbor">
<p> This is Gloucester harbor. I give tours sometimes as we exit the harbor. </p>
