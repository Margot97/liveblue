<p> This Humpback whale is diving so that the tail, or fluke, is visible. This behavior is called fluking, and typically happens before a longer and deeper dive. The multiple whale watching boats in the background show the popularity of Stellwagen bank as a whale watch spot. </p>

<p> The plume you see coming off of this Humpback whale is not water, it's the whale's breath. These are called spouts, and can be used to identify the species of whale. </p>
<img src="http://img.ourdoings.com/q8/cj/j453m.jpg" alt="Whale sounding">
<p> This is a Humpback whale performing a sounding dive. During a sounding dive, the whale's back arches but the tail does not come out of the water. These are typically shorter, shallower dives. The hump that is formed as this whale sounds is how the humpback whale got its common name. </p>
