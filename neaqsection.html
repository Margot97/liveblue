<h2> New England Aquarium </h2>
<h3> My job </h3>
<p> I am a Visitor Education Volunteer, or VE, at the New England Aquarium. VEs are the people you see standing around everywhere helping with the touch tank, and giving information on the animals. The aquarium has many many interns, employees, and volunteers. Here, in short, is the process I went through to start work at such a large and complicated organization. </p>
<h4> How to become a volunteer/intern at the aquarium </h4>
<ol>
<li> Fill out their online application at <a href= "http://www.neaq.org/get_involved/volunteering_and_internships/volunteering/volunteer_application.php" > http://www.neaq.org/get_involved/volunteering_and_internships/volunteering/volunteer_application.php </a>. You will get a confirmation email after you submit it. </li> <br>
<li> After waiting a long time, contact the volunteer coordinator, Noel Keady. He is usually good about responding to emails, but nothing is guarenteed. If you try to reach him by phone, he may or may not be in the office. There may or may not be Anyone in the office. You could be on hold for a while. Be patient. If you reach him, things will go a lot faster. </li> <br>
<li> If they are interested in you, you may now schedule the first interview. In this particular interview, Noel might be undergoing an assessment of his interviewing skills as well. You'll both be similarly nervous, but don't worry, you'll do just find. </li> <br>
<li> Your interview and availability will be reviewed with the higher-ups, and at this point if they're still interested in you, they will send you an email to schedule a second interview. This is the last one, I promise. </li> <br>
<li> You'll come into the same room you had the first interview in, and get a feeling of deja-vu. Just relax, and be yourself. At this point, the second interview is basically a formality. They're getting to know you, and seeing how well you'd fit. </li> <br>
<li> You will have to commit to one day a week for six months. This will not be enough hours for your school-required internship, so you'll have to make a website about it as well. </li> <br>
<li> Get trained to do different stations, and start working! </li>
</ol>
